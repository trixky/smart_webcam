# smart_webcam

A simple [online](https://trixky.github.io/smart_webcam/) AI project to demonstrate how to use a webcam to detect objects with [tensorflow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js?hl) and the pre-trained model [coco-ssd](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tensorflow-models/coco-ssd).

> The model is loaded on the client side and all calculations are made on the device.
